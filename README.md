# Hi 👋, I’m Nishant Raj

I’m a **backend developer** who enjoys building projects, debugging systems, and exploring new technologies and frameworks.

I approach backend development from **first principles**, focusing on understanding every nuance of how systems work—how requests flow, how data is handled, and how performance and reliability are affected by design choices. I like solving complex issues by breaking them down logically and fixing them at the root.

I’m an **avid hackathon participant** and enjoy working on challenging problems under real constraints. Hackathons have helped me think fast, build pragmatically, and collaborate effectively while shipping working solutions.

### 🛠 Tech Stack
- **Languages**: Go, JavaScript, TypeScript  
- **Backend**: APIs, system design, performance optimization  
- **OS**: Linux (currently using **Pop!_OS**)  

### 🌱 Open Source & Learning
I like contributing to **open source**, reading other people’s code, and experimenting with new tools and frameworks. I believe strong fundamentals matter more than tools, and I’m constantly learning to improve as an engineer.

### 🚀 Goals
I aspire to become a **great developer** who builds and leads **meaningful projects** that create real impact.
